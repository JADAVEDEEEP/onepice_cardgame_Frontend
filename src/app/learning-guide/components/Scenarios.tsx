      question: "What should you do?",
      answer: "1) Refresh Phase - Nothing to untap (skip)\n2) Draw Phase - Draw 1 card, add 1 DON!! (only 1 on turn 1)\n3) Main Phase - Consider playing a low-cost Character or saving DON!! for next turn\n4) End Phase - Pass turn",
      tip: "On turn 1, you only get 1 DON!!, so play wisely!"

      question: "You attack the Leader. Opponent plays no Counter. What happens?",
      answer: "Your attack succeeds! (5000 ≥ 5000)\n\nYour opponent takes 1 damage:\n- They take 1 card from their Life area and add it to hand\n- They now have 2 Life remaining\n- Your Character becomes rested",
      tip: "Equal power means the attack succeeds!"

      question: "Should you use the Counter?",
      answer: "YES! Use the Counter:\n\nWithout Counter: 5000 < 6000 → You take 1 Life damage\nWith Counter: 5000 + 2000 = 7000 > 6000 → Attack blocked!\n\nYou reveal the Counter card, add +2000 to your Leader's power, and the attack fails. The Counter card goes to trash (you don't pay its cost).",

      answer: "After playing the Character:\n- You spend 3 DON!! to pay the cost\n- You have 1 DON!! remaining\n- YES, you can attach that 1 DON!! to give the Character +1000 Power\n\nFinal state: Character on field with 1 DON!! attached, 0 DON!! in pool",

      question: "Which defense should you use?",
      answer: "ANALYSIS:\n\nOption 1 - Use Blocker:\n- Blocker intercepts (6000 vs 8000)\n- Blocker is KO'd, but Leader is safe\n- You keep your Counter card\n\nOption 2 - Use Counter on Leader:\n- Leader defends at 7000 (5000 + 2000)\n- Attack still succeeds (8000 > 7000)\n- You take 1 Life damage AND lose Counter card\n\nBEST CHOICE: Use the Blocker! Save Counter for later.",

      question: "What Counter value do you need to survive?",
      answer: "CRITICAL SITUATION:\n\n[Double Attack] deals 2 Life damage instead of 1!\nYou have 2 Life → If attack succeeds, you LOSE THE GAME!\n\nTo block:\n- Opponent's Power: 7000\n- Your Leader: 5000\n- Need: +2000 Counter or higher\n\nWith +2000 Counter: 5000 + 2000 = 7000\n7000 ≥ 7000 → Attack blocked, you survive!\n\nAnything less than +2000 and you lose!",
      tip: "Always check for [Double Attack] - it can end games quickly!"

      question: "How should you distribute DON!! and attack?",
      answer: "OPTIMAL STRATEGY:\n\nAttack 1: Character with 2 DON!! attached (7000 Power)\n- 7000 > 5000 → Forces opponent to use Counter or take damage\n\nAttack 2: Character with 1 DON!! attached (6000 Power)\n- 6000 > 5000 → Another threat\n\nAttack 3: Character with 0 DON!! (5000 Power)\n- 5000 = 5000 → Still succeeds!\n\nEven if they block one attack, you're likely to deal 2+ damage total. This puts massive pressure on their Counter cards!",
      tip: "Multiple small attacks can be better than one big attack - it forces opponent to use multiple Counters!"
    },

      question: "Which should you play?",
      answer: "DEPENDS ON YOUR HAND:\n\nIf you have 2+ Characters in hand:\n→ Play the Stage! It will boost all future Characters\n→ Next turn you can play Characters that are stronger\n\nIf you only have 1 Character:\n→ Play the Character now\n→ Stage is better with multiple Characters to boost\n\nSTAGE VALUE CALCULATION:\n- Stage affects 2 Characters: +2000 total power\n- Stage affects 3+ Characters: Even better!\n\nLong-term investments like Stages pay off if you can protect them.",
      tip: "Stages are investments - they're best when you have cards to follow up!"

      question: "Does your attack succeed?",
      answer: "STACK RESOLUTION:\n\n1) You declare attack: 6000 vs 5000\n2) Opponent responds with Event: Target Character becomes 8000\n3) Stack resolves: Counter effect applies first\n4) Compare Power: 6000 vs 8000\n\nRESULT: Attack FAILS (6000 < 8000)\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Events with [Counter] timing work like Counter cards\n- They can boost power beyond just +1000/+2000\n- Stack resolves opponent's effects before damage\n\nThis is different from regular Counter cards - Events with [Counter] often provide bigger boosts!",
      tip: "Watch out for Event cards with [Counter] timing - they can provide massive boosts!"

      question: "What's your optimal play sequence?",
      answer: "OPTIMAL SEQUENCE:\n\n1st: Play 3-cost Event (Draw 2 cards)\n   → 4 DON!! remaining, hand refilled\n\n2nd: Evaluate new cards from draw\n\nOption A (Aggressive):\n- Play 5-cost [Rush] Character (8000 Power)\n- Can't afford 4-cost anymore\n- Can attack immediately with [Rush]\n- Pressure opponent NOW\n\nOption B (Board Development):\n- Play 4-cost Character (6000 Power)\n- Save DON!! for Counter protection\n- Build board more safely\n\nBEST CHOICE: Usually Option A!\nThe [Rush] Character attacks immediately, and you drew 2 cards for future turns. This is tempo advantage!",

      question: "Which Counter should you use, or should you take the damage?",
      answer: "ADVANCED DECISION:\n\nOption 1: Use Counter +1000\n- Block fails (6000 > 6000)\n- Take 1 Life card to hand\n- Now at 0 Life but hand has powerful 7-cost Character\n- Still alive!\n\nOption 2: Use Counter +2000\n- Block succeeds (7000 > 6000)\n- Stay at 1 Life\n- But you used your better Counter\n\nOption 3: Take damage intentionally\n- Add Life card to hand (more resources!)\n- Save both Counters\n- Use them to protect next turn\n\nBEST: Option 1 or 3!\nLife cards become hand cards - they're resources! Don't over-protect Life if you can use it strategically.",

      question: "How do you survive?",
      answer: "SURVIVAL ANALYSIS:\n\n[Double Attack] + 2 Life = If attack succeeds, YOU LOSE!\n\nCannot use both Blocker AND Counter:\n- Blocker intercepts → becomes target\n- Counter can only boost the blocker OR leader, not both\n\nOPTION 1: Blocker intercepts\n- Battle becomes 7000 vs 9000\n- Add Counter +2000 to Blocker: 9000 vs 9000\n- TIE! Blocker survives, Leader safe! ✓\n\nOPTION 2: Counter on Leader (NO BLOCKER)\n- Leader: 5000 + 2000 = 7000 vs 9000\n- Attack succeeds, 2 Life damage\n- YOU LOSE ✗\n\nCORRECT ANSWER: Use Blocker, then Counter on Blocker!\nThis is the only way to reach 9000 Power defense.",
